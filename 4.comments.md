# Lessons learned

## Blockchain and Physical Geo locations; two questions come to mind:
blockchain is about trust, how to define a safe solution to mark a location as passed --> geolocation can easily be spoofed or 'emulated'.
* possible solution; [platin.io](https://platin.io)??
* Vehicle knows route, but does not know specific waypoints that are used to validate route.


How to mark a point as passed;  
1. vehicle does a ping with location to contract, if contract is near enough then point = passed:  
	* cons; high in network traffic, accuracy depending on speed and time between pings,  
	* pros; vehicle has no knowledge of waypoint location (safe).
2. vehicle gets first geolocation from contract, and notifies contract of passing geo point upon receiving next point -> 
	* cons; easy to spoof --> vehicle knows next location
	* pros; low in network traffic, accuracy limited by used hardware
3. How to represent a geo location in solidity?
	* geo location is in latitude/longitude ranging from -90..90/-180..180
	* precision is required, 5 decimals equals to 1.1 meter precision
	* possible solution is store location as int32 and multiply latitude/longitude with 100000 to get required precision
	* how to calculate position, client or contract?
