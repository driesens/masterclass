# Finalizing

The goal of the homework is finalizing our solution and preparation to demo.

NOTE: It is required to complete prev homeworks before this homework.

## TODO
1. Main contract (@someone who can develop)
    * Design of contract

        ```
          -----------------           ------------
          | main contract | --------> | RDWToken |
          -----------------           ------------
                 |          \
                 |           \      * --------------
                 |            `-----> | Safe Route |
                  \                   --------------
                   \  * ----------------
                    `-> | road manager |
                        ----------------
        ```

    * Write unit tests
2. SafeRoute contract (@someone who can develop)
    * Update design on SafeRoute:
        1. Add driver address
        2. Add array of all locations mapped to road managers
        3. Add function for visiting location. Driver should have possibility to visit location only once, during the step amount of tokens should be transferred to appropriate road manager.
3. User interface (@Sergii)
    * RDW side
        1. Represent main contract:
            * Display address of token contract
            * Display overview of SafeRoutes
            * Display overview of road managers with balances
            * Creation SafeRoute
                1. Adding road manager to the SafeRoute
                2. Adding points(locations) attached to road manager
            * Adding road manager
    * Driver side
        1. Represent SafeRoute:
            * Display balance of the contract
            * Display all road managers
            * Display all points attached to road manager
4. Next steps (@everyone)
